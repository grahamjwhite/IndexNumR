#' Generate an index of months
#'
#' A function to create a month index variable
#'
#' @param x A vector or column of dates
#' @param overlapWeeks Tells monthIndex how to deal with weeks that
#' cross over two adjacent months. Options are "naive", "majority", "wholeOnly" or "fourWeek".
#' "naive" simply takes the month number of the observation, ignoring where
#' the week of that observation falls. "majority" will allocate the observation
#' to the month that owns the majority of days in that week, assuming
#' that Monday is day one of the week. "fourWeek" first calculates a week index,
#' then calculates the month index assuming that there are four weeks in each month.
#' "wholeOnly" will return NA for any dates falling inside a week that overlaps two
#' adjacent months; that is, only weeks that are wholly within a month
#' are given an index value. The default is "naive".
